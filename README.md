BaySmile Dashboard was a part of toy concept that will recognize kids feeling and friends with them. The dashboard use transfer learning method and 
trained on open-source dataset of facial emotions. In the process, hypertuning parameters was done by tuning epoch, split portions, and based model. 
Dashboard was made with Python, Gradio, and Keras Tensorflow. In this project, Iâ€™m contributing by built dashboard as proof of concept.
